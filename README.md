# Hopper's Quest

# A Grid Based Puzzle Game

## Overview
Hopper's Quest is a turn-based puzzle game where you play as Hopper, a brave frog with a big appetite for bugs. The goal is to eat all the bugs on the grid without falling off, advancing through increasingly challenging levels.

## Gameplay
In Hopper's Quest, you control Hopper, a frog that can jump over tiles to eat bugs. The game is played on a grid, and your objective is to eat all the bugs on the grid without falling off.

## Rules
* Jumping: Hopper moves one tile at a time.
* Puzzle Objects: Hopper needs to come up with ideas to eat all the bugs keeping mind all the puzzle objects.
* Boundaries: If Hopper jumps off the grid, he falls into the water, and the level restarts.
* Winning: Eat all the bugs to advance to the next level.

## Strategy
Plan your moves carefully to avoid falling off the grid. Some bugs are placed in tricky positions that require you to think a few steps ahead. Use the objects to your advantage to navigate the grid efficiently.

## Controls
Use WASD keys to navigate Hopper across the grid.
